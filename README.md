📖 Overview

app.js – The heart of the app: JavaScript logic using HashMap to shorten and store URLs

⚙️ How It Works
The user inputs a long URL into the designated field.

Upon clicking the "Shorten" button, the app generates a unique short URL.

The mapping between the original and shortened URL is stored using a HashMap.

The short URL is then displayed to the user and can be used for redirection.
